find random game computer can't solve
lay out controls more clearly
hide deck / remove with back of card? keep control to show deck?
refactor $.posts to application/json (does it matter?)
create a spinner while waiting for engine moves
display engine lines? execute move by selecting line? display only top engine lines?
engine hint
different, more appropriate http error when clicked cards don't add to 13?
